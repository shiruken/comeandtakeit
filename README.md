# "Come and Take It" - A Design for the March for Science

I created this riff on the "Come and Take It" flag [used during the Texas Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_and_take_it#Texas_Revolution) for the [2017 March for Science](https://marchforscience.com/). Since people have been asking about using it for their signs and t-shirts, I am releasing it via the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. This means you are free to share and adapt the design for any purpose so long as you properly attribute it and distribute it using the same license.

This repository includes the original Adobe Illustrator file as well as vectorized PDF and SVG versions. There are also PNG versions rendered at 600, 300, and 150 pixels-per-inch.
