<img src="ComeAndTakeIt_150ppi.png" width="200px" />

I created this riff on the "Come and Take It" flag [used during the Texas Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_and_take_it#Texas_Revolution) for the [2017 March for Science](https://marchforscience.com/). Since people have been asking about using it for their signs and t-shirts, I am licensing it under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. This means you are free to share and adapt the design for any purpose so long as you properly attribute it and distribute it using the same license.

This repository includes the [original Adobe Illustrator file](ComeAndTakeIt.ai) as well as vectorized [PDF](ComeAndTakeIt.pdf) and [SVG](ComeAndTakeIt.svg) versions. There are also PNG versions rendered at [600](ComeAndTakeIt_600ppi.png), [300](ComeAndTakeIt_300ppi.png), and [150](ComeAndTakeIt_150ppi.png)ppi.
